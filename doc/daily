Current staff count is 69 of which 63 are billable and 6 are not
Of the 63 billable, 57 are assignable and  6 are not
Of the 57 assignable employees, 50 are billing today


Daily utilization is billing as a percentage of assignable
That is, non-billable people and those out on vacation are omitted from the calculation
For today, that is 50 / 57 = 87.7%
