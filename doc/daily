Current staff count is 69 of which 63 are billable and 6 are not
Of the 63 billable, 56 are assignable and  7 are not
Of the 56 assignable employees, 43 are billing today


Daily utilization is billing as a percentage of assignable
That is, non-billable people and those out on vacation are omitted from the calculation
For today, that is 43 / 56 = 76.8%
